# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

The following assignment presents a model of a consumer choosing how much time to allocate to working in order to get the money for consumption.
As we will see in the assignment the equilibrium time allocated to working will differ for different wage levels, elasticites for labor and what tax bracket the consumer is in.

First we will construct a function using python, that solves the maximization problem.
Second we plot the labour and consumption as functions of the wage. Discovering a break in the trend as the top tax bracket sets in.
Third and fourth we present the tax revenue produced in our model, using to different values for the elasticity of labour supply, epsilon. 
And lastly we seek to find for which standard income tax, tob bracket income tax, and cut off for the top income tax bracket that maximizes tax revenue.
