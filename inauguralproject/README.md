# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

The following assignment presents a model of a consumer choosing how much time to allocate to working in order to get the money for consumption.
As we will see in the assignment the equilibrium time allocated to working will differ for different wage levels, elasticites for labor and what tax bracket the consumer is in.
