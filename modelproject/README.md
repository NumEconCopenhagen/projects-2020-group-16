# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Stackelberg duopoly model** and is about the Stackelberg model, which is a dynamic sequential move model concerning competition on quantities between two firms where one is moving first, and the other firm moves second.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [theModelProject.ipynb](theModelProject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
